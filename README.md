# workshop task
spreadsheets are not my strong suit... decided to do a very simple data visualisation similar to the workshop example because i liked the way it looked, and couldn't really think of a better way to make a data visualisation. the data i used is the number of different types of sweets/chocolate i had eaten that week by the day. i had a lot of trouble at first because when i imported the csv files it put colons inbetween the numbers instead of commas for some reason so nothing was working until i realised that. i really just followed the instructions from the workshop and it worked out great. i would like to try playing around with other less linear ways of arranging the data though.
